# repo-97-Reactjs-ETE
* react from scratch

# Hy , this is vivek. here im giving my own documentaion of React , that anyone can understand.

# reactjs documentation:
* https://react.dev/

## why react ðŸ¤”?
* React is an javascript libarary for building user-interfaces.
* single page applications 
* if we click on link in website wholepage no need to reload , only the component wil reload

## but why we already have html ,css etc. then why React ðŸ˜’?
* we can tell its an resuable.
* if we created one time , we can use multiple times , so we are going to create components.
* we can use on html template for many things , so we just change content of the words , but template will be same
* using same html for different components , we use react

## who created react?
* it was created by facebook , for themselves 
* later many developers started using it , so it became popular.
* hence , they made react as an open-source

## Tools:
* chrome
* VScode 
* NOdejs / NPM
* Git / Github

* Chrome DEv Tools
* NPM node package manager
* Linux / Terminal

## linux commands:
* cd
* cd ..
* pwd
* mkdir folder_name
* rm -r folder_name 
* touch file.txt
* 

## fro linux tips
* npm init 
* npm install react-toastify --save

## create react app
* npx create-react-app my-first-app
* cd my-first-app
* npm start

## tips:
* src folder is for devlopers , we will do all 

## webpack
* webpack.in we can use this for conveting many html , css ,javascript into one file (one html , one css ,one javascript)

## fro creating a component:
* function PrintName() {

}

* we must give return for the component
* the first should be Capital for the component name
* jSX = JavaScript XML

## JSX (java scipt xml) rules:
1. return single element
2. "return" if we have multiple statements , we can keep return () paranthesis for writing in next line
3. we can use semantic html , but not giving always "div" , etc if we can create nav bar 
4. fragments : React.Fragment , if we dony need container , we can use this fragment for no need of sections
5. we are adding the function name to root children "id = root"
6. normal functions , arrow functions 
* for arrow functions : const App = () => {}
* for normal fuinction : function App () {}
7. if we want ot givee attributes , we should give in camel case only "className={}" 
8. if we want o give class to html element  < section class="container"> , we should not use "class" , we have class keyword , so it will give some warning , but not error <sections classNAme="container">
9. we have to give closing tags , or it wil show eroors 
10. In JSX we can write Java Script also by giving curly brakets {} , const firstNAme = "emma; , <h1> hello {first name + " " + lastname}</h1> , we can create objects and functions we can sue. 


## some things we should know :
1. for components : we always give first letter as capital like const App = () {} ,
2. for functions : we alwasy should give function printNAme() {}
3. it is not possible to write JS code in html , but in react JSX it is possible by mentioning {} , we can write JS code inside the curly brackets in html
4. in React we have , function components and class components

## so , documentation is best place to learn :
